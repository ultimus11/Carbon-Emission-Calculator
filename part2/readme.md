Here we calculate CO2 emissions for petrol and diesel cars.
We do it by assuming average 150 grams/km CO2 emission for petrol car & 
130 grams/km for diesel cars.
We also assume that speed of car is between 0-80km/hr. and fuel economy for petrol car is 13-16 km/liter  and for diesel car it is 16-18km/liter.
If we think of entire population on earth which travels using combustion engine vehicles the amount of CO2 emission is very high that's why we need to shift toward renewable resources and electric vehicles.
This app is intended to create awareness among people about global warming and carbon emissions.
Next time you check path for your journey please use this app to check on carbon emissions.
